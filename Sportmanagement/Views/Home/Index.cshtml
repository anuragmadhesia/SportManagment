                Sports are good for any nation.Various games are played in India.India has excelled in few games and failed in various other games.Our individual performances are outstanding in some games but lack of team work can be seen at various sports.Proper sports policy could have helped in doing better performances at Olympics.
                In the last 50 years,the government's role has not been quire upto the marks.A country of 90 crores people fails miserably at important world sports event like World Cups,Olympics,Asiads,etc.

                In athletics again,India's performance has been poor.The largest team goes to the Olympics and comes without winning any medal.In the last fifty years India had not got any medal. In 1984,P.T Usha,the sprint queen remained away from winning a bronze medal in hurdle race by fraction of a second,though she did outstanding performance by Milkha Singh,the flying Sikh of India.
